title: How to Choose a Linode Plan
---

Linode offers four plan tiers: **Nanode**, **Standard**, **Dedicated**, and **High-Memory**. Before selecting a plan, it is important to understand each plan's specifications, like CPU, transfer, storage, and RAM. An understanding of your project's own needs and requirements is also useful. Linode allows you to easily change plans at any time. View the [Resizing a Linode](/docs/platform/disk-images/resizing-a-linode/) guide to learn how to change your plan type.

This guide provides an overview of all Linode plan types and their corresponding use cases.

## 1. Nanode

The Nanode plan is great place to begin if you are new to the world of cloud hosting and are unsure of your requirements. This plan offers the basics and begins at $5 / month. With this plan you have a fully functioning server with your preferred Linux distribution. The Nanode is quick to deploy and it can be expanded to a larger plan as your demands increase.

### Use Cases

- Personal Projects
- Portfolio websites
- Small self-hosted services
- Virtual Private Network
- Prototypes and proof-of-concept demonstrations

### Specifications

|Nanode   | Specs   |
|---|---|
|RAM   | 1GB    |
|CPU   |1 CPU Core   |
|Storage   | 25 GB SSD Storage   |
|Transfer   | 1 TB  |
| Network In | 40 Gbps |
| Network Out | 1000 Mbps |

## 2. Standard

The Linode Standard plans begin at 2GB of RAM with 1 CPU core and go all the way up to 192GB of RAM with 32 CPU cores. These plans are designed to support a wide range of modern cloud hosting needs from personal projects to production workloads.

### Use Cases

- Web Apps and Websites
- Game, Media, and Database servers
- Commercial services
- Corporate Virtual Private Networks
- Containers
- Clusters
- CDN Nodes

### Specifications

|Standard   | Specs   |
|---|---|
|RAM   | 2GB    |
|CPU   |1 CPU Core   |
|Storage   | 50 GB SSD Storage   |
|Transfer   | 2 TB  |
| Network In | 40 Gbps |
| Network Out | 2000 Mbps |

## 3. Dedicated CPU

Dedicated CPU plans offer entire dedicated physical CPU cores for your own Linode's use. There is no physical CPU sharing, like there is in Nanode, Standard, and High-Memory plans. This is important in scenarios that require consistent zero-latency operation, prolonged maximum capacity operation of CPU resources, and applications that need to run at peak efficiency.

### Use Cases

- Intense CI/CD workflows,
- CPU intensive game servers, like Minecraft or Team Fortress 2
- Media transcoding
- Data Science, Scientific Computing, and Machine Learning

### Specifications

|Dedicated   | Specs   |
|---|---|
|RAM   | 2GB    |
|CPU   |1 CPU Core (dedicated)   |
|Storage   | 50 GB SSD Storage   |
|Transfer   | 2 TB  |
| Network In | 40 Gbps |
| Network Out | 2000 Mbps |

## 4. High Memory

High Memory plans increase your system's available RAM while keeping other resources (CPU, storage, etc.) roughly the same, helping to keep your costs down and adding power where you need it.

### Use Cases

- In-memory databases
- Applications that require large amounts of caching
- Large software repository hosting

### Specifications

|Dedicated   | Specs   |
|---|---|
|RAM   | 24GB    |
|CPU   |1 CPU Core  |
|Storage   | 20 GB SSD Storage   |
|Transfer   | 5 TB  |
| Network In | 40 Gbps |
| Network Out | 5000 Mbps |
