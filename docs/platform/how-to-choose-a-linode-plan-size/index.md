Linode offers four plan tiers:

- Nanode
- Standard
- High Memory
- Dedicated

Each plan incrementally increases your Linode's available CPU cores, RAM, storage, and network transfer allowance. You can change plans at any time and with no additional charge.


## Nanode

A Nanode is our entry-level, most basic plan. A great introduction the world of cloud hosting, Nanodes are quick to deploy can be expanded as your demands increase.

**Ideal for**: Personal services and projects such as a portfolio website or Git repository, VPN, educational lessons, and prototype or proof-of-concept demonstrations.


## Standard

Our standard plans cover a range of resource allowances suitable for any personal or production workload you may have.

**Ideal for**: Everything from larger-scale personal services such as game and media servers, to commercial services such as web and database servers, corporate VPN, container clusters or CDN nodes.


## High Memory

As the name implies, High Memory plans increase your system's available RAM while keeping other resources (CPU, storage, etc.) roughly the same, which helps keep your costs down.

**Ideal for**: Data structure applications, applications which benefit from large amounts of in-memory caching, hosting large software repositories.


## Dedicated

Dedicated CPU plans reserve a host machine's virtual CPU cores exclusively for your Linode's use. This is important in scenarios which require consistent zero-latency operation or prolonged maximum capacity operation of CPU resources.

**Ideal for**:  Intense CI/CD workflows, CPU intensive game servers such as Minecraft or Team Fortress, media transcoding, scientific calculation.
