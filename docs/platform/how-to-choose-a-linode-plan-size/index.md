---

Linode offers four plan tiers:

- Nanode
- Standard
- High Memory
- Dedicated

Each plan incrementally increases your Linode's available CPU cores, RAM, storage, and network transfer allowance. You can change plans at any time and with no additional charge.


## Nanode

A great introduction the world of cloud hosting, our Nanode plan gives you access to the basics. The Linode Nano is quick to deploy can be expanded as your demands increase.


|Nanode   | Specs   |
|---|---|
|RAM   | 1GB    |
|CPU   |1 CPU Core   |
|Storage   | 25 GB SSD Storage   |
|Transfer   | 1 TB  |

## High Memory

High Memory plans increase your system's available RAM while keeping other resources (CPU, storage, etc.) roughly the same, which helps keep your costs down.

**Ideal for**: Data structure applications, applications which benefit from large amounts of in-memory caching, hosting large software repositories.


## Dedicated

Dedicated CPU plans reserve a host machine's virtual CPU cores exclusively for your Linode's use. This is important in scenarios which require consistent zero-latency operation or prolonged maximum capacity operation of CPU resources.

**Ideal for**:  Intense CI/CD workflows, CPU intensive game servers such as Minecraft or Team Fortress, media transcoding, scientific calculation.
